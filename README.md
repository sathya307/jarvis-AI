# JARVIS/AI
python code for a simple chat box


speechrecoganisation program. A simple chatbox or simple jarvis like a companion.
it will read news,tell time ,and you can add more features in it.

we need to import ,some for our program to run.
i used gtts form google and i used mpg123 pacakge ( you can download it from here"https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpg123/" )
for reading news ,i used urllib2. In python 3.7 "urilib.request".

LET'S JUMP INTO AI.
        A small use of ai in python.it can act like taking tom too. we can add some more features in it like adding youtube,
        changing our desktop bg image etc..
